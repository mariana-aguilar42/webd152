  <p>My favorite beverage is water. I think to some that might be a weird answer but I prefer
    to drink water over other beverages. I always have my resuable water bottle with me because when I get thirsty, water is what satisfies me. There are times where I crave a soda like at the moveis or a coffee when I need to get a lot of work done but typically I always have water next to me as well.</p>
